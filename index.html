                    <p>
                        I'm interested in a lot of stuff. Despite me knowing that it's more optimal to master single activity, I can't help but keep looking into new stuff. One of these is a webside you are at right now. Writing this, i'm not entirely sure how it all will turn out, but I sincerely hope for best.

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was forced to go shool, for some reason. Almost none of the information there was interesting for me, aside from <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</abbr>-related stuff. I was really into solving chellenging math and physics problems, and completely ignored any topic aside those. And oh I do regret nothing!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once graduated, I assigned for a Physics Faculty of a <abbr title="Kievan National University">KNU</abbr> and for some time I was absolutely thrilled by a magic of physics and beautiful mathmatics behind it. Both of these are as spellbinding, as nature itself, if you know where to search.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A garbage nation occured on <time>Fabruary 2022</time>, and I was completely sidetracked. The university malfunctioned by that time already, and ongoing war did not help with this problem. While I was in safety the same could not be said about my colegues. So after a year of "studying" I decided to halt it.

                        At the time of me writing this, the above text is actually my entire education story. Of course, I've been learning various stuff for my entire life, but above paragraphs is all that you can call "real education". Despite that, It won't end this way. I keep begging this world for knowledge, and hope to update this section soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from educating myself, I help students akin to me in shool to learnig STEM disciplies. My goal is to inspire people, so we could appreciate world of math and physics together.

                    <h3>STEM</h3>
                    <p>
                        While studying at KNU, I spent most of my time creating documented description of various experiments we conducted (so-called "protocol"). In essense, these were meant to be scientific articles, describing scientific theory, experiment setup, conducted results and their following analysis. I'd really want them to help you as a sort of template and would <b><em>love</em></b> to have discussion about results I've got and related physics/math topics.

                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        I <b><em>enjoyed</em></b> playing games for as long as I remember myself. The only thought, that a game is sort of film, that you are able to influence resonated with me very well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it was all far from serious, until I discovered Minecraft. Provided I loved to play games in first place, a sandbox game with infinite world, immesurable building capabilities and adaptive gameplay just blew my mind, and I was in constant search for even a slightest moment to enjoy it.

                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        Logicaly, provided my STEM-oriented mind, I was introduced to coding back in school. For a long time I had a purely math-related interest in it, so once accomodated with a basic PASCAL syntax, I was set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But at some point, I discovered mods for Minecraft. It tool some time to understand that, but apparently even the most advanced and breathtaking of them were usually written by a single person. At that point, I realised: <q>If someone can do it, then I can probably too?</q>
                        After investigation, I found that mods and Minecraft itself are written in Java, and I just started to learn it, bit-by-bit. Yes, Jav was my first Object-Oriented Language, and I absolutely don't regret that - for me Java prooved to be more intuitive, but for you of course it may not.
                        The concepts of OOP suppeenly clicked switch in my head: previously Minecraft seemed to me like some sort of magic that noone but chosen can master. After that, it all become trivial to me: you break the program into small pieces (methods), group them (objects) and use them to your liking. These ideas might be trivial, but <em>the behaviour</em> a code may have in case you use them is infinitely complex. But in essence, this <q>complex structure is simple bricks, arranged in simple patterns, creating in simple shapes.</q>

                        So now, with the background mentioned above I'm capable of understanding really hard math and physics-related theories, and at the same time, I love creating pretty stuff. So, why not create something to be remembered by? A tonn of attempts behind, here is what I got:
