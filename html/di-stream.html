                <h2>What is DiStream</h2>
                DiStream, or Distributed Streaming is a project, that I planned for myself to substitute centralised streaming services. The idea is to transfer data from streamer to viewer, directly. This sort of independency, despite requiring more setup, results stream page being much more customisable, flexible, and completely free of ads and censorship. You stream and say whatever you want, that's your stream and your content.
                But wait, how would I discover new creators, then? Well, any creator is free to post his DiStream link anywhere on the network for you to follow, or you may use search a lookup list of creators on a dedicated site.
                No hope this sort of streming will be more popular, then centralised one, but it surely will find it's use.
