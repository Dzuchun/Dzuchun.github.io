# Interactive trigonometry

This is a tool for showing properties of trigonometric functions and solving simple equations.<br>
I desighned it myself, for personal use. But I'd be happy to know this tool helps someone else.<br>

## Known issues:

On my mobile device minus sign would not be inputted. Have no clue why<br>

## Released features:

## Indev features:
Visualy select angle<br>
Set angle as value, both in rad and degree<br>
Ability to increment/decrement angle by arbitrary amount<br>
Guiding nodes to set angle precisely<br>
Show angle value, both in degree and radians<br>
Ability to sweep arc to specified angle<br>
Propose pi as an additional multiplier<br>
Display pointer's mirrors<br>

## Planned features:

Show angle sin/cos/tan/ctan functions<br>
Allow user to querry wolframalpha for trigfunction values<br>
Show function's negative and positive zones<br>
Show function's "greater than" and "less than" zones for simple fractions<br>
Show function's "greater than" and "less than" zones for arbitrary expressions<br>
Querry little formula database<br>
Each formula has a set of parent formulas, and possibly wiki ref<br>
You may ask wolfram about formula<br>
Ability to share application state as a string<br>
