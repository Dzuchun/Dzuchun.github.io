# Interactive trigonometry

This is a tool for showing properties of trigonometric functions and solving simple equations.<br>
I designed it myself, for personal use. But I'd be happy to know this tool helps someone else.<br>
[Video Guide (it's a Rickroll for now)](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)<br>

To anyone willing to audit the code: prepare to die of cringe.

## Known issues:

TEX IS KINDA CURSED, I KNOW<br>
Sometimes, if state loading failed, graph will no longer respond to clicks<br>

## Released features:

Visualy select angle<br>
Set angle as value, both in rad and degree<br>
Ability to increment/decrement angle by arbitrary amount<br>
Guiding nodes to set angle precisely<br>
Show angle value, both in degree and radians<br>
Ability to sweep arc to specified angle<br>
Propose pi as an additional multiplier<br>
Display pointer's mirrors<br>
Show angle sin/cos/tan/ctan functions<br>

Query WolframAlpha for trigfunction values<br>
Show function's negative and positive zones<br>
Show function's "greater than" and "less than" zones for simple fractions<br>

Ask WolframAlpha for formula<br>
Query little formula database<br>
Each formula has a set of parent formulas<br>
Display dashed lines for zone dividers<br>
Toggle if values are displayed instead of expressions for guidelines<br>

## Indev features:

Share application state as a string<br>

## Planned features:

Add ability to reset only **one section** at the time<br>
Show function's "greater than" and "less than" zones for arbitrary expressions<br>
Show tex-based values everywhere<br>
